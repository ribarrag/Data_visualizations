# Final project: draft 1
## Increasing need to oversee children's screen time on social media in the U.S.: the cases of Instagram and Tiktok

## Main idea / description
The idea of the project is to present data about the increasing use of social media among children (ages â‰¤ 18) in the U.S., and the main negative effects of unsupervised long screen time, espcially the cases of Instagram and TikTok.

## Arc of the story
I think the most general structure of the story is the following:

<div style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images_project/SM RIG 11.jpg" alt="Graph with U.S. total social network usage from 2018 to 2027" width="600" 
     height="500">
</div>

I will start by giving an overall context about the usage of social networks in the U.S. among all population. This will keep the audiecne in a neutral mood. Then I will briefly touch upon some statistics related to kids use of social networks, still providing the audience with background information, which perhaps can be slightly surprising, depending how much they know about the subject.

After that, I will briefly mention the (lack of) involvement in children's usage of social media. This might raise an eyebrow in the audience as the overall involvement is low, especially when compared to other countries, like Spain.

Next, I will present some positive impact of social media on children, for which I still need further data. This should make the audience feel slighly optimistic.

However, next comes the negative impact of two cases: Instagram and Tiktok. Although the evidence is limited, there is some research that points toward some negative effects: on mental health and addictive behavior. The mood of the audience will turn pesimistic or even alarmed.

And I close with the call action, which will be along the lines of :  
- Parentd should get more involved in their children's use of social media
- There are some tools available that help parents monitor and limit social media use. We should be aware of these tools, and use them.
- Perhaps very few or no one in the audience will be a parent, but they might have relatives who are parents to young children, or have relatives who are children, so people in the audience can also: spread the word among family who have kids, and get involved in the use of social media by the children in their families.

## A first outline
Social network penetration has constantly increased in the world and in the U.S., where it is projected to reach almost 100% of the population.
Virtually everyone will be ctively using some sort of social media.

Overall, the average American spends most of their time in social media on facebook, and youtube. Instagram and TikTok are used by 52% and 34% of the total population.

Lets turn our attention to the children, who increasingly have access to portable devices, and with it, access to a plethora of social media applications.

The average American child spends most of its time on social networks using apps related to social media, with TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram leading the rankings, with 99, 84 and 39 minutes on averages per day. In second place come video related applications and in a far tird place education related apps.

## Method and medium
I will use mainly Flourish to create the visualizations, and I will use Shorthand to create the story and present it.
