The message is clear that we need to be careful of social media usage for children but i think it can be made more specific to parents or parents-to-be by telling them the specific steps they can take to control it. Maybe give examples of those 'tools' that you mention."      |
| Do you think the color palette fits adequately with the overall presentation and the subject addressed?  | Text        | "the colors are very catchy." "The palette reminds me of Instagram user-interface."      |

and results summarized

| Question      | Intention | Summarized replies     |
| :---        |    :----:   |          :----: |
| To you, what is the main message of the presentation?      | Detect if I was being able to convey the main message properly       | in general terms, interviewees understood the main point of the presentation: "the main message appears to be that social media is harmful for children because it creates negative emotions related to their self-worth." or "parents should get more o". However, I think I should nuance the message because I do not intend people to perceive the message as "children shouldnt be allowed to use social media".
| Did you find anything memorable?   | Text        | To this question I got different replies: One person thought that it was "the impact of social media on the brain. I had never imagined that there is a science behind this addictive behavior.", while another "the reduced concern of parent to their children's use of social media". I think those answers provide good insight on what elements I should emphasize a bit during the presentation to make it more memorable to the audience.      |
| Did any of the data surprise you??   | Text        | "the fact that social media negatively impacts girls more than boys."      |
| Do you think the call to action is compelling?   | Text        | And more      |

- the text along with table-17 is a bit too long. Maybe you should try to bold some text that is important, or color code it, and use the entire space left-to-right to display this text. Right now it's just on the left-side of the screen and i had to keep scrolling up and down to see the table and the text.

Do you have any questions or doubts after the presentation?
- why did you focus only on instagram and tiktok? why did you focus on age 14 when you presented stats on smarphone usage in children? 


- add a title to the U.S. map explaining what it shows. be more specific in the final section where you are telling parents what to do - use bullet points or pictures so that the idea is easy to remember.
