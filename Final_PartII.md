### Interview scripts 


|No.| Question      | Intention |
| :---|    :----:   |          :----: |
| 1  | To you, what is the main message of the presentation? | Detect if I was being able to convey the main message properly |
| 2  | Did you find anything memorable?                      | Check if I have any strong points in the presentation        |
| 3  | Did any of the data surprise you?                     | The surprise factor might make people remember the message more        |
| 4  | Do you think the call to action is compelling? If not, how would you make it more persuasive?        | Creating a good call to action is one of my main concerns and I fell like it was still a bit weak        |
| 5  | Do you think the color palette fits adequately with the overall presentation and the subject addressed?                      | I feel the palette is a bit too alive, I wanted to make sure that it is not distracting for the audience        |
| 6  | Do you have any specific graph or text that you didn’t understand fully?                     | To make sure that the graphs are clear        |
| 7  | Do you have any questions or doubts after the presentation?                 | To make sure that the structure of the presentation is clear        |
| 8  | Are there any final recommendations you’d like to make? | Open ended question to check if there are any additional comments not covered in the questions        |


|Question  | Summarized replies |
| :---     |    :----:          |
| To you, what is the main message of the presentation? | In general terms, interviewees understood the main point of the presentation: "the main message appears to be that social media is harmful for children because it creates negative emotions related to their self-worth." and "There should be a check on the social media usage of children". However, I think I should nuance the message because I do not intend people to perceive the message as "children shouldnt be allowed to use social media" |
| Did you find anything memorable?                      | To this question I got interesting replies: One person thought that it was "the impact of social media on the brain. I had never imagined that there is a science behind this addictive behavior.", and another "Yeah, how screen display impacts parts of brain and creates addiction", while the third one mentioned "the reduced concern of parent to their children's use of social media and the 17% increase in screen time caught my attention." I think those answers provide good insight on what elements I should emphasize a bit during the presentation to make it more memorable to the audience.         |
| Did any of the data surprise you?                     | The part that talks about Instagram's impact was the more surprising: "the fact that social media negatively impacts girls more than boys."; "21% of US girls (teenagers) feel worse or much worse about themselves after using Instagram. These statistics surprised me.". I think this is positive feedback about having caught the audience attention.          |
| Do you think the call to action is compelling? If not, how would you make it more persuasive?        | "I do not understand what the last map presents. Perhaps it is showing something related to parental control in U.S. states." and "add a title to the U.S. map explaining what it shows." relate to the same element. This is something I need to work on, because it feels like the map has nothing to do there, I am considering removing it for the final version. "The message is clear that we need to be careful of social media usage for children but i think it can be made more specific to parents or parents-to-be by telling them the specific steps they can take to control it. Maybe give examples of those 'tools' that you mention." This comment is very useful to enhance my call to action, as well as this one: "be more specific in the final section where you are telling parents what to do - use bullet points or pictures so that the idea is easy to remember."   |
| Do you think the color palette fits adequately with the overall presentation and the subject addressed?                      | Tha answers for this one surprised me a bit, I thought people would be less receptive to the varying colors: "the colors are very catchy." "The palette reminds me of Instagram user-interface."       |
| Do you have any specific graph or text that you didn’t understand fully?                     | "the text along with table-17 is a bit too long. Maybe you should try to bold some text that is important, or color code it, and use the entire space left-to-right to display this text. Right now it's just on the left-side of the screen and i had to keep scrolling up and down to see the table and the text." I also need to think about how to present the information from the graph that I ahve pending: "The hand-drawn graph was a little confusing. "       |
| Do you have any questions or doubts after the presentation?                 | HERE        |
| Are there any final recommendations you’d like to make? | I feel like I got some of the most useful comments in the answers to this question: "you may add some transitions by adding banners which may have clear headings as we move between topics". I also got this very specific recommendation: "the text along with table-17 is a bit too long. Maybe you should try to bold some text that is important, or color code it, and use the entire space left-to-right to display this text. Right now it's just on the left-side of the screen and i had to keep scrolling up and down to see the table and the text.". Lastly, these two comments were also important as they are more general about the presentation, I should try to clarify these two elements: "why did you focus only on instagram and tiktok? why did you focus on age 14 when you presented stats on smarphone usage in children?" |
