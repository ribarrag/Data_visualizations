 Past versions of the process
 
 
Intervew script

What is the main message of the presentation?
- the main message appears to be that social media is harmful for children because it creates negative emotions related to their self-worth.

Did you find anything memorable?
- the impact of social media on the brain. I had never imagined that there is a science behind this addictive behavior.

Did any of the data surprise you?
- the fact that social media negatively impacts girls more than boys.

Do you think the call to action is compelling?
- I do not understand what the last map presents. Perhaps it is showing something related to parental control in U.S. states. The message is clear that we need to be careful of social media usage for children but i think it can be made more specific to parents or parents-to-be by telling them the specific steps they can take to control it. Maybe give examples of those 'tools' that you mention.

Do you think the colorr palette fits adequately with the overall presentation and the subject addressed? If not, what would be a better selection?
- the colors are very catchy. They remind me of Instagram user-interface. I think you should keep this palette.

Do you have any specific graph or text that you didn’t understand fully?
- the text along with table-17 is a bit too long. Maybe you should try to bold some text that is important, or color code it, and use the entire space left-to-right to display this text. Right now it's just on the left-side of the screen and i had to keep scrolling up and down to see the table and the text.

Do you have any questions or doubts after the presentation?
- why did you focus only on instagram and tiktok? why did you focus on age 14 when you presented stats on smarphone usage in children? 

Are there any final recommendations you’d like to make?
- add a title to the U.S. map explaining what it shows. be more specific in the final section where you are telling parents what to do - use bullet points or pictures so that the idea is easy to remember.
