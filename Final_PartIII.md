**Brief overal desrcription of project**

I started out with the iodea of presenting how socila media use has increased during the pandemic, and how it has -in a way- been shaping how people spend their free time. I even consider the idea of talking about how social media is reducing our attention span, as we are now more used to getting information and content in formats of a few characters, or short videos.

After much thinking and some research, I decided to do it about the effect of social emdia on mental health, and then narrowed it down to children, as the new generations are more exposed to social media, and its being a core part of their development. 

I constrained the story to the U.S., as I gound more data available, and because there are many factors that are different across countries: access to technology, education in use of these technologies, presence of major social media apps, etc.

With this in mind, I drafted a very rough first version of what the storytelling should look like (Part I), and continuosly refined the work to its final product.

In this Part III, I would like to empasize the following **changes made since the completion of Part II:**

- From the feedback I got during the interview process of Part II, I trimmed parts of the data story that people had problems understanding. I used a shorter version to present, and then I recovered back some of the elements and tried to tie them better into the overall data story for the final submission. 

- As concrete examples, I discarded a map that people were having trouble understanding, and I felt like it was not essential for the storytelling. I also removed an introductory slide, which I think created confusion and was not very impactful, and instead chose to open the presentation with some data. 

- I got rid of a Shorthand “Scrollmation” when showing the percentage of boys and girls who feel worse after using Instagram and instead only left two static graphs, as the movement was not really adding any value to the data story.


- One of the most fluctuating aspects of my presentation throughout the process was defining the call to action. I started with a vague idea of how to make people aware of the risks of social media for children. After some rounds of feedback, I decided to create a call to action that invites people to set up parental control tools in their children's social media applications. 

- Another change I made was to include the “Poke me” phrase into the title. This, after receiving a comment about the title being too descriptive and not catchy, and I changed the background image to a mostly white one.

- From Part II to III, I created an animated graph that shows the increase in average time spent by children on each major social media app. I had a hard time defining which graph to use, even so that in Part II that graph was still just a hand-drawn table with data. I think the graph captured the attention of the audience during the presentation and reinforced the argument of TikTok being possibly addictive. 

- I used some additional colors in the first version of my presentation, but I ended up just using just one of them, and the rest in either black or gray. From the beginning, the idea was to use the Instagram palette, which includes about six different colors (<span style="color:#405DE6">**blue**</span>, <span style="color:#833AB4">**purple**</span>,<span style="color: #E1306C ">**purple red**</span>, <span style="color: #FD1D1D ">**red**</span>, <span style="color: #F56040">**orange**</span>, <span style="color: #FCAF45">**yellow**</span>). However, after the feedback, I brought it down to using only black, gray, and Instagram rose to highlight what I wanted people to focus on; I used purple very rarely. This is compared to my Part II version, where I used purple frequently and even some oranges. I received positive feedback during my presentation from the color palette, so I think it was the correct decision to still use Instagram colors, but not all of them, and not so often. 

- Also, I got feedback about being less general and more specific in the data that I was presenting during Part I and II, and I think that really helped. I discarded some graphs about smartphone ownership among children in the U.S., and device ownership across income levels and ethnicity. I think those numbers were interesting, but they were very general and didn’t help to strengthen the argument.

- Finally, as I worked on refining the graphs and flow of the data story, I felt more comfortable with working on Flourish and Shorthand and discovered more functionalities of both applications.

**Audience for the final data story**

- During Part I and some of Part II, I was thinking about a very general audience, but as I developed a clearer idea of my call to action, I decided that I was speaking to parents of young children that use social media. As I needed to consider that I was presenting to young graduate students who, in most cases, might not be parents, I decided to add a line in the call to action that invites them to recommend using parental control to family and friends.
