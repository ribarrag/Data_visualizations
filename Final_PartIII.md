Final story shorthand

**Changes made since completion of Part II**

I trimmed part of the presentation that people had problems understanding. I used a shorter version to present, and then for the final deliverable version, I recovered and enhanced some of the elements that I left out for the presentation I recovered back some of the elements and tried to tie them better into the overall presentation. 
As a concrete example, I decided not to use a map I was initially considering because it was not essential for the argument, but then I brought it back for the final version. Another examples was an introductory slide which I discarded and didn't bring back, as I think it was better to open the presentation with key statistics, instead of a slide explaining what the issuetopic is about. The title is serving this purpose. 

I also removed a Shorthand “Scrollmation” that showed the percentage of boys and girls who feel worse after using Instagram and instead only left two static graphs.

One of the most fluctuating aspects of my presentation throughout the process was defining the call to action. I started with a vague idea of how to make people aware of the risks of social media for children. After some rounds of feedback, I decided to create a call to action that call people to set up parental control tools in their children's social media applications. 

I also included the “Poke me” part into the title, because I received comments about the title being too descriptive and not catchy, and I changed the background image to a mostly white one.

From part II to III I created an animated graph that shows the increase in average time spent by children on each major social media app. I had a hard time finding which graph to use, even so that in Part II which was the only graph that was still a handmade version of a table with data. I think the graph captured the attention of the audience during the presentation, and reinforced the point of TikTok being allegedly addictive. 

I had a first version that had many more colors. From the beginning, the idea was to use the Instagram palette, which includes about 6-six to seven colors that, include blue, purple, purple-red, Instagram rose, red, orange, and a couple of yellows. However, after the feedback, I brought it down to using only black, gray, and Instagram rose to highlight what I wanted people to focus on; I used purple very rarely. This is compared to my Part II version, where I used purple frequently and even some oranges. I received positive feedback during my presentation from the color palette, so I think it was the correct decision to still use Instagram colors, but not all of them, and not so often. 



**Identification of audience**

Dring Part I and some of Part II, I was thinking about a very general audience, but as I developed a clearer idea of my call to action, I was speaking to parent of young children that use social media. As I needed to consider that I was presenting to young graduate students who, in most cases, are not paretns, I decided to add a line in the call to action that invites them to recommend using parental control to family 

**Key insight from interviews**

I got feedback about being less general and more specific in the data that I was presenting during Part I and II, and I think that really helped. I dicarded some graph about smartphone ownership among childen in the U.S., and device ownserhip across income levels and ethnicity. I think those numbers were interesting, but they were very general and didn’t help to strengthen thee argument.


**Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.**

**Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story.** 


I think the main takeaways from this project for me were:
How important it is to present your materials to others, and have them comment and evaluate them over multiple iterations before actually presenting It. 
I also feel like I leanrt abut having a structure to go from an idea to a story using data
Finally, as I worked on refining my graphs and the flow of the presentation, I discovered more functionalities of both Flourish and Shorthand, and I think they are simple to use, but also very flexible tools that allow for a good deal of customization, so I that makes them great tools to create presentations in the future.


Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)

Presentation




NOTE: You don't need to re-write or recreate content you've already created for parts I and II of this assignment as long as it's already organized in an easy-to-follow way.  The writeup for the final project on Github should serve as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how you created your work.  When reviewing Part III of your final assignment, I should be able to clearly follow along in your progress - noting how you used everything you've created in Part I and Part II to develop your final project. 

Part III: Final data story (due as part of this assignment)

A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 
Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet.  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.
