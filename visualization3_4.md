# Critique by design
URL: https://ribarrag.github.io/portfolio/visualization3_4.html  
I have selected the following graph to critique. It appeared in a report from the Congressional Budget Office.

<div style="text-align: center;">

- For starters, it is not a terribly bad designed graphed: it presents interesting, truthful and complete data. 

- However, in m opinion, it's not presented in a very intuitive way: it contains different shapes for different years, so the user’s eyes must travel back and forth to check which year belongs with which shape. 
- Additionally, it is not very clear why the grey area means in the context of this graph. 
- Although the main message that the authors wanted to convey was that the highest inflation was that of energy goods and services and of durable goods, there is nothing in the graph that highlights them.
- I think that, aesthetically, it is a clean graph only using gray and white in the background, without many gridlines, but it could be perceived as slightly busy with many shapes. 
- The graph could also benefit from a better use of color and a more engaging title.
- I think that the primary audience for this graph are specialists in public finances. In this sense, I think the graph is effective at reaching its audience. However, the reports from the Congressional Budget Office are oftentimes used for informing “lay people”. If this graphed were presented to someone who is interested in this information but doesn’t have a technical background, then I think it could use some improvements to make it more clear, digestible and engaging.
- For intance, the use of abbreviations as CPI-U for the labels might not be easy to interpret for a general audience. 
- I would add a more engaging title
- I would rotate the graph so inflation is on the y axis
- Instead of shapes, I would use bars
- I would also use a dotted line to represent the average instead of a new shape (or bar)
